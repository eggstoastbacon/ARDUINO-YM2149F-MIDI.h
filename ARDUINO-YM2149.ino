/*
 * Arduino YM2149 MIDI Synth v0.5
 * 
 * Original code developed by yukimizake.
 * Video demonstration: Soon.
 * Schematics: Soon.
 * Based on re-factored code by Dansfing / dansfing.uk (https://dansfing.uk/YM_v2_1b/YM_MIDI_lib_Screen_buttons/YM_MIDI_lib_Screen_buttons.ino)
 * Updated PCB design and modifications for 2024 by crunchypotato for HobbyChop.
 * OLED display not initially supported in this version but the pins are available on the PCB headers.
 * Replaced 2 samples for Channel 10 with smaller samples.
 * Added comments to playNote code.
 * Remapped velocity 1-127 to 64-127 and implemented velocity examples in MIDI CH. 1 and 4. 
 * Future progress will be in commit messages.
